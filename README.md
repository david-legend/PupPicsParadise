## How it looks

<br/>

### Dogs List Screen

This screen renders a list of dog breeds and sub breeds. If a dog breed has a sub breed, the card can be expanded to view the sub breeds.   
On each bread and side breed, there are 2 icons:
- the first icon (photo icon) navigates you to screen which shows you a random image of the breed/subBreed selected.
- the second icon (camera icon) navigates you to screen which shows you an image list of the breed/subBreed selected.

## Architecture Overview

![Screenshot](assets/screenshots/flutter-app-architecture.webp)

The app uses the domain driven design approach. This architecture comprises four layers (data, domain, application, and presentation).

- The presentation layer holds the UI and widgets - (actions and events flows from the presentation layer to the application layer) 
- The application layer holds the controllers, states and services.  (this layer determines how to handle the events based on the state of the app)
- The repository layer receives the events and determines which data service should handle the request based on the nature of the request
- The data layer communicates with outside data sources like API or internal local storages like sharedPrefs or SQL and returns the data back to the repository

## State Management & Networking 

This app uses Riverpod as its state management and Dio for networking calls.
